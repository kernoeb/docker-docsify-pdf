# 1 - Use case

This link is very [cool](example.md).

This one doesn't have an extension, but it works : [example](example).
Another way : [example](usecase/example).

A specific link in the page [here](example#specific-section)
Another specific link in the page [here with .md](example.md#specific-section)
Another specific link in the page [here with query param](example?id=specific-section)
Another specific link in the page [here with .md and query param](example.md?id=specific-section)

-> This is also [cool](/usecase/cool)
-> A [link with a slash](/usecase/example.md)
-> [README.md](/README.md)
